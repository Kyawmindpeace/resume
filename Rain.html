    <h2>The Peace of a rainy day</h2>
    <p>If there's anything more satisfying than hearing rain on the roof
        it's the sweet smell of clean air and wet ground after a deluge. Hayfever sufferers should be especially
        grateful. </p>
    <p>Rainy days when your kids are little are going to be the days that you will miss most when they grow older. Days
        where you could just stay home and enjoy the sweet sound of rain and snuggle without purpose on the couch
        reading books and watching movies.</p>
    <p>Some People feel the rain. Others just get wet.</p>
